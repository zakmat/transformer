transformer
===========
Transformer was created as a project for my Compiler Techniques class at Warsaw University of Technology.

It's purpose was to demonstrate understanding of the ideas and concepts presented in lectures.

Transformer is a simple XML and XSLT parser as well as XML generator.

It parses source and style documents and produces result document by applying transformation from the stylesheet.

It is working, however I would not assume it's complete or something...
Rather than that it should be used for educational purposes, it demonstrates whole proccess of parsing: from lexical analysis, through syntax analysis to generation of the output document.

Hope you'll enjoy it.

You are free to use and modify this code by any means you want.
